# No Scripts for Code Refactoring (CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Using automated scripts (sed, awk, powershell, batch scripts) to modify code files.**

<rationale>
- Scripts only change text, they don't understand context or imports
- 2026-01-23 incident: `sed` changed `React.FormEvent` → `FormEvent` but forgot imports → compilation errors
</rationale>

### ✅ Allowed
- Use AI tools: `replace_file_content`, `multi_replace_file_content`
- MUST verify imports are correct after every change

### ❌ Forbidden
- `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `powershell -Command`, `find ... -exec`
- Any batch text processing

### Exception
If absolutely necessary:
1. Get explicit human approval FIRST
2. Show complete script for review
3. Explain why manual tools can't do it

### Remember
**Scripts are blind. AI should be intelligent.**
